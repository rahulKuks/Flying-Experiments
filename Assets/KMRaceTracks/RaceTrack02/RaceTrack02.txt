RT02 – Red Rock Raceway

3100 meters long track with combination of nicely flowing cornes. Ample run-off areas are provided in case things go wrong. 
Optimized for the best combination of smooth corners and low polygon numbers.
10206 vertices and 9698 triangles. (in max configuration)
trees come in one sided and two sided versions. One sided saves you 1460 vertices and 730 triangles. Two sided can be seen from behind, for example in rear view mirrors.  
Separate road (tarmac) and surroundings (grass) collider meshes. Different physics materials are used for each. Staying on the black stuff WILL pay off!
Distance boards before the corners to help you judge the braking point accurately.
Rally style turn boards indicating the direction and sharpness (4 levels – green to red) of upcoming turns. Learning of a new track is going to become easier than ever before.
Sharp curbs will make you pay for cutting the corners too much.
Hundreds of spectators to cheer you on.
Starting grid and finish line. Time to race!
All features (boards, curbs, grids) are separate meshes. You can easily customize the track by removing them.
